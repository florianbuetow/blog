  summary: This article explores the concept of the "Default Heuristic" in tech selection
    for production systems, advocating for the use of established, reliable technologies
    over novel, untested alternatives to ensure stability, maintainability, and reliability.
    It warns against the "Optimization Fallacy," which is the pursuit of perfect solutions
    at the expense of simplicity and resource efficiency. Real-world examples from
    Pinterest and StackOverflow illustrate the benefits of using proven technologies
    like SQL databases and familiar frameworks to minimize risks and leverage community
    support. The article also provides guidelines on when to apply the Default Heuristic,
    emphasizing its advantages in resource-constrained projects, critical applications,
    and scenarios requiring rapid scaling or unclear long-term requirements.
